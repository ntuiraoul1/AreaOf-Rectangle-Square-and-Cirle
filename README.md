# AreaOf-Rectangle-Square-and-Cirle
This is a Dart program for calculating properties of a rectangle, circle, and squar.

Classes:

It defines separate classes for each shape (Rectangle, Circle, Square) or a base class (Shape) with subclasses for specific shapes.
Properties:

Each class has properties to store the shape's dimensions (e.g., width, height for rectangle, radius for circle, side length for square).
Methods:

Each class could has methods to calculate relevant properties like area and perimeter.
Rectangle: calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter().
Circle: calculateArea() using pi * radius * radius and calculatePerimeter() using 2 * pi * radius. (assuming pi is a constant or accessible through a library)
Square: calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter() using side length directly (both are sideLength * sideLength and 4 * sideLength respectively).
Main Function:

The program has a main function where you:
Create instances of each shape class, providing their dimensions.
Call the methods on each shape object to calculate area and perimeter.
Print the results for each shape.
